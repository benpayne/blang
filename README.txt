1. Threading is integrated and elegant.
2. Thread saftey is easy and where elegant, transparent.
3. Eventing is integral to the language.
4. Garbage Collection and Reference counting are integral.
5. It should be easy to prototype in this language and it should be easy to 
  support large projects.  Formalization is optional.
6. Compiler should have options to enforce certian design patterns.
7. Should be able to synthsis routines into FPGA's
